History
The first wallet program called Fcoin-Qt was released in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto as open source code. Fcoin-Qt, also called "Satoshi client" is sometimes referred to as the reference client because it serves to define the Fcoin protocol and acts as a standard for other implementations. As of version 0.9, Fcoin-Qt has been renamed "Fcoin Core" to more accurately describe its role in the network.

Initially, Satoshi Nakamoto delegated the right to make decisions on changing the code of the official version of the wallet to Gavin Andresen, who, in turn, transferred it in 2014 to Vladimir van der Laan. The introduction of any changes to the next release of the program except the main developer agrees with other developers of the kernel: Jeff Garzik, Gregory Maxwell and Peter Wooll.
